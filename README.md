# naadsmtools
A set of scripts and code to help with analysis of NAADSM output.

The [North American Animal Disease Simulation Model](http://www.naadsm.org/)
simulates spread of diseases among agricultural units on a landscape.
The simulation of disease spread and interventions to disease spread includes
visualization and analysis tools. The scripts here extend these
analysis tools.

* Convert output from NAADSM into an event-based file format in HDF5.

* Visualize spread of disease with a movie format.
